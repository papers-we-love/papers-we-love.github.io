    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.</p>

    <p>We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">papers-we-love's curated repository</a>. Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>

    <p>Joel VanderWerf stops by to talk about Calvin.</p>

    <p>Joel studied math at Harvard and Berkeley, getting his PhD for work on decompositions of finite algebraic structures. He taught at U of Louisville and then helped develop a multithreaded C++ object database used in Apple and Netscape software. Back at UC Berkeley, he worked on vehicle automation, communication, control, and safety systems, and on data analysis and simulation of transportation networks. Now he works on Tupelo, a transactional tuplespace sharing some of the ideas of Calvin, and RedShift, a simulation framework in Ruby and C that aims to be the open-source Simulink.

</span></p>

    <p>Kyle Kingsbury presents the On the attraction between two perfectly conducting plates paper.</p>

    <p>In Kyle's words:  "It's a very short physics paper–a sidenote, really, to work he considered much more important. Sixty years later, though, we consider this sidenote his defining work–it gave rise to one of the weirdest physics phenomena ever, and has only gotten <em>more</em> confusing since the original proof. There's a really interesting history behind it that reveals some of the sociology of academia. Plus it's just fucking fascinating physics.</p>

    <p>It also doesn't require any math beyond, say, high school calculus, but illustrates what a rigorous formal argument looks like–and I'm well-prepared to teach the math and concepts to an audience without any mathematical expertise. I think it'd be a really interesting contrast to some of the more industry-oriented papers we've seen recently.</p>

    <p>The value here isn't in direct applicability so much as getting our brains into a different discipline's way of communicating a proof."</p>

</span></p>

    <p>Leif Walsh , engineer at Tokutek (and from PWL NYC), comes to visit us! Leif will present the Level Ancestor Simplified paper by Bender and Farach-Colton.</p>

    <p>Leif tells us: " My favorite problems are always those with the highest ratio of difficulty in solving to difficulty in stating.  The lowest common ancestor problem exemplifies this.  It was first stated in 1973, and can be described to anyone in two sentences, or with one sentence and a picture.  But it took 11 years before an optimal solution was discovered, and another 16 before an understandable and implementable solution with the same bounds was presented, in this paper, The LCA Problem Revisited.  This problem is furthermore satisfying because its bounds are so tight: pre-processing takes as long as just reading the input, and queries are constant time.</p>

Speaker: <a href="http://twitter.com/pbailis">Peter Bailis</a>

</span></p>

    <p>Peter Bailis presents the "Managing Update Conflicts in Bayou, A Weakly Connected Replicated Storage System" paper by Doug Terry, Marvin Theimer, Karin Petersen, Alan J. Demers, Mike J. Spreitzer, and Carl H. Hauser in SOSP 1995.</p>

    <p>Peter tells us: "A perennial challenge in managing shared, mutable state in distributed systems is the ability to permit concurrent writes while maintaining some degree of application "correctness." Bayou is an excellent and early example of an "optimistic" strategy for handling the concurrent update problem. Many of the techniques in Bayou—such as dependency tracking, application-specific merge procedures, and log shipping—are increasingly popular, can be found in systems like Dynamo, and help understand when and why mechanisms like CRDTs are useful."</p>
