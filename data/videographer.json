AI memory has emerged to address this, enabling long-horizon continuity and user personalization in LLM applications by intelligently hydrating the context window before inference. Zep is a low-latency, temporally aware, graph-based AI memory architecture. Zep reports strong performance on the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR) and LongMemEval (LME) benchmarks, and is among the most well-known architectures in the space today. Zep retrieves and reconstructs relevant information across histories exceeding 115,000 tokens, as demonstrated in LME.\n\nRylan Talerico is co-founder and CPO of Retriever, where he works on AI memory and personalization. A self-taught engineer who dropped out of high school to self-direct, Rylan founded Crate.fm, a cloud storage and collaboration platform for musicians, before starting Retriever.

It spans a spectrum from random-input fuzzing, which is fast but struggles with complex conditions, to symbolic execution, which uses SAT solvers to systematically reach hard-to-hit paths—though these solvers can become prohibitively slow on complex constraints. Exe strikes a balance through concolic execution: it runs bare-metal code on concrete inputs while instrumenting paths with logical constraints, invoking a solver only when needed to explore alternate branches. This approach combines the speed of concrete execution with the path-finding power of symbolic methods, avoiding the full cost of traditional symbolic engines.\n\nMichael Vaughn (he/him) has a PhD in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and is a senior software engineer at Antithesis, working on their hypervisor and fuzzer.

When you write a well-typed program, you've an assurance that certain facts about your program will always be true; at no point is a string passed to a function that expects an tuple argument, nor will one that is supposed to return an array have a corner case where it actually returns an int. The more expressive your type system is, the more specific those certain facts can be - a type system that supports generics can specify what type the keys and values of an dictionary must be, but for example, still couldn't specify that each element is an even integer. We'd need a more expressive type system for that! Programming language researchers are interested in exploring different ways to add expressivity to type systems without sacrificing usability. Liquid Types, published at PLDI in 2008, combines traditional type theory techniques with SMT solvers from the automated theorem prover research community to form a fascinating point in the design space. We'll begin by discussing the broader context around the work, learn a bit about how to digest an academic type theory paper, and then work through the details of the paper with the help of a toy implementation of the technique.\n\nNathan Taylor is a PhD student at UT Austin, where he ponders the intersection of formal methods and distributed systems.

Historically, polynomial approximations for elementary functions have been designed by approximating the real value. In contrast, we make a case for approximating the correctly rounded result of an elementary function rather than the real value of an elementary function in the RLIBM project. Once we approximate the correctly rounded result, there is an interval of real values around the correctly rounded result such that producing a real value in this interval rounds to the correct result. This interval is the freedom that the polynomial approximation has for an input, which is larger than the ones with the mini-max approach. Using these intervals, we structure the problem of generating polynomial approximations that produce correctly rounded results for all inputs as a linear programming problem. The results from the RLIBM project makes a strong case for mandating correctly rounded results at least for any representation that has fewer than orequal to 32-bits. \n\n----\n\nVideo Sponsor: Cerner - https://engineering.cerner.com/?promo=pwlconf2022","published_at":"2022-10-21 12:00:50.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vAcf6d26kiM/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT43M2S","view_count":1964,"like_count":61,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"paperswelove","category_id":"28","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:35:11.727394Z","updated_at":"2026-01-25 18:55:59.712614Z"},

These systems create unique experiences and interactions for the player every time they play, ideally leading to a longer, deeper engagement with the game. Most PCG systems are based on one-way interaction, where the system generates content for the player based on internal rules set by the game developers. However, what if there was a way to have the player influence how the content is generated? What if the system could learn from the players, and adapt its design process in real-time? In this talk, I'll show how game developers can create that two-way feedback loop between the player and the back-end AI system to create content that feels more human-like, more challenging, and more engaging. \n\n----\n\nVideo Sponsor: Cerner - https://engineering.cerner.com/?promo=pwlconf2022\nCaption Sponsor: Datadog - https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/?promo=pwlconf2022","published_at":"2022-10-17 12:00:41.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uU-6AREzcIc/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT49M42S","view_count":505,"like_count":7,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"paperswelove,gaming","category_id":"28","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:35:11.731325Z","updated_at":"2026-01-25 18:55:59.716598Z"},

Some are dazzling, some are pedestrian, some are insightful, and some reward long periods of quiet contemplation. They stir up an emotional reaction that goes beyond the strictly rational, and can often be deeply personal.\n\nIn graduate school, during a period of identity crisis, I came across Matthias Felleisen's “On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages”. At a time when the world was ruled by C++, I had immersed myself in Scheme, so I always looked skeptically at mainstream linguistic claims. However, the language wars seemed beyond rational discourse. So the idea that someone could take a concept as nebulous as “expressiveness&rdquo and formalize it was already a revelation. But the beauty of this paper goes well beyond that: it also lies in the cleanliness of the approach, the correspondence of the formalism to intuition, and the tautness of its execution.\n\nIt was the most stunning paper I had ever read, and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul.\n\nUnfortunately, this paper may not be easy to read for the uninitiated: it depends on a certain amount of “cultural knowledge” of programming language theory. I hope to peel off some of those layers and help you, too, understand the paper — hopefully while preserving the joy and beauty I experienced.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n\nOn the expressive power of programming languages\nFelleisen M.\n(1991)  Science of Computer Programming,  17  (1-3) , pp. 35-75.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016764239190036W\n\nBiography\n----------------\n\nShriram is the Vice President for Programming Languages at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA.

In particular, the P2P network currently forwards content in a structured way that allows observers to link users' Bitcoin addresses to their IP addresses. This is a substantial privacy vulnerability that extends to several other cryptocurrencies as well. In this talk, I will discuss how these attacks work, and how effective they are at deanonymizing users. I will also talk about countermeasures, including proposed modifications to the networking stack. \n\nReferences\n------------------\n\nAn analysis of anonymity in Bitcoin using P2P traffic by Philip Koshy, Diana Koshy, and Patrick McDaniel; FC 2014 (https://www.ifca.ai/fc14/papers/fc14_submission_71.pdf)\n\nDeanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P network by Alex Biryukov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Ivan Pustogarov; CCS 2014 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7418)\n\nDandelion: Redesigning the bitcoin network for anonymity by Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Giulia Fanti, and Pramod Viswanath; Sigmetrics 2017 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.04439)\n\nAnonymity properties of the Bitcoin P2P network by Giulia Fanti and Pramod Viswanath; NeurIPS 2017 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08761.pdf)\n\nBiography\n----------------\n\nGiulia Fanti is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

This information is useful for various real-life applications such as supporting software developers (e.g., bug-finding tools, code refactoring tools, and code recommenders) and compiler optimizations. Program analysis is also used to ensure complex software adheres to standards and regulations (e.g., medical devices, car industry, and aviation industry).\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the three main properties that enable program analyses to be useful in practice: scalability, precision, and usability. I will relate that to various papers that have been published in the field of program analysis, as well as some of the work that my group has done. I will conclude with where I see program analysis research going and the challenges that we aim to solve in the field. \n\nReferences\n------------------\n\nStrictly declarative specification of sophisticated points-to analyses by Martin Bravenboer and Yannis Smaragdakis (https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/doop-oopsla09prelim.pdf)\n\nDimensions of Precision in Reference Analysis of Object-Oriented Programming Languages by Barbara G.

Now, in 2019, we find ourselves in need of a successor to carry Runciman's banner. Despite major advances in type systems and the growing adoption of the slogan 'make illegal states unrepresentable', we often rely on Integers in cases where negative values have no meaning. Runciman's paper reminds us of a fact that we all know: the choice in types can change the nature of an API. Integers are often the default in many systems and APIs, often for no reason beyond programmer familiarity. In this talk we will argue two main points: that for many cases Natural numbers retain all of the positive aspects of the Integers with none of the negatives, and that when designing a system or an API we should constantly be asking ourselves \"What about X?\" \n\nReferences\n------------------\n\nWhat About the Natural Numbers by Colin Runciman (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0096055189900040?via%3Dihub)\n\nBiography\n----------------\n\nJosé Manuel Calderón Trilla studied Music Engineering Technology at the University of Miami before pursuing graduate work in Natural Computation (MSc) and Programming Languages (PhD) at the University of York in the UK.\n\nAfter his PhD work he became a Research Scientist at Galois, Inc. working mostly on Quantitative Information Flow, compilers, and abstract interpretation.

For over two decades, the Paxos algorithm has been synonymous with distributed consensus. Paxos is widely deployed in production systems, yet it is poorly understood and it proves to be heavyweight, unscalable and unreliable in practice.\n\nIn this talk, we re-examine the foundations of how Paxos solves distributed consensus. Our hypothesis is that these limitations are not inherent to the problem of consensus but instead specific to the approach of Paxos. The surprising result of our analysis is a substantial weakening to the requirements of this widely studied algorithm. Building on this insight, we are able to prove an extensive generalisation over the Paxos algorithm. \n\nReferences\n------------------\n\nDistributed consensus revised by Heidi Howard (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-935.pdf)\n\nThe part-time parliament by Leslie Lamport (https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf)\n\nPaxos Made Moderately Complex by Robbert Van Renesse and Deniz Altinbuken (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7412/2011sp/paxos.pdf)\n\nFlexible Paxos: Quorum intersection revisited by Heidi Howard, Dahlia Malkhi, Alexander Spiegelman (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06696)\n\nA Generalised Solution to Distributed Consensus by Heidi Howard, Richard Mortier (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06776)\n\nthe morning paper: Distributed consensus revised - Part I (https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/05/07/distributed-consensus-revised-part-i/)\n\nthe morning paper: Distributed consensus revised - Part II (https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/05/08/distributed-consensus-revised-part-ii/)\n\nthe morning paper: Distributed consensus revised - Part III (https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/05/10/distributed-consensus-revised-part-iii/)\n\nBiography\n----------------\n\nDr. Heidi Howard is a research fellow based at Cambridge University’s Department of Computer Science and Technology.

Researchers have been studying consensus for decades, resulting in numerous algorithms and white papers. Unfortunately, many of these algorithms are flawed and unreliable.\n\nHowever, in 2011, a team of researchers published a paper on a novel approach to distributed consensus using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00609399v1/document). This paper created quite a buzz as it showed that CRDTs were mathematically proven to guarantee consensus through \"Strong Eventual Consistency.\" They also claimed to have solved the CAP conundrum.\n\nThis presentation dives into this seminal paper in order to answer the hard questions. What are CRDTs? How do they work? And most importantly, does it actually solve CAP? By the end of this talk, everyone in the audience will have a foundational understanding of CRDTs and how they can be applied to their own work.\n\nBest of all, I will be explaining all of this is as simple language as possible.

Computer scientists call this problem consensus, and when the computers involved are in an asynchronous environment, it's distributed consensus.\n\nFor about a decade prior to this paper, computer scientists had been debating whether distributed consensus was solvable in real environments. At the time, it was known that synchronous consensus, a weaker version of distributed consensus where everyone acts at the same time, was possible — and even better, it was resilient to crashed or unreliable processes. But was the same true for distributed consensus? Can you design a distributed consensus algorithm that is resilient to these kinds of failures?\n\nAs the paper's title (\"Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process\") might suggest, the answer is \"no, it isn't possible\".

Concurrency bugs are as commonplace as concurrent programs themselves, and often arise due to subtle synchronization errors. This makes concurrent programs excellent targets for computer-aided programming, and, in particular, for automated generation of synchronization code.\n\nUnsurprisingly, synchronization synthesis has been a long-standing interest in the formal methods and programming languages community since the early 1980s. An interesting piece of history is that the seminal 1981 paper of Clarke and Emerson, which founded the highly successful area of model checking (recognized with a Turing Award in 2007), was, in fact, a paper on synthesis of synchronization from temporal logic specifications. The community has come a long way since then, with several practical and scalable solutions for synthesis of synchronization and coordination for concurrent and distributed programs.\n\nIn this talk, Roopsha will highlight some of these contributions, with an emphasis on recent advances in a trace-based approach that is applicable to device driver programming. She will end the talk with a preview of an ongoing project on parameterized synthesis of coordination for distributed applications.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n\n- Design and Synthesis of Synchronization Skeletons Using Branching-Time Temporal Logic by E.

Nevertheless, programmers are discouraged from using it because of the difficulty of writing clear, correct programs. This is embodied for example in the Go Language slogan “Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.” But do we have the right abstractions for message-passing concurrent programming? I argue that we do not (yet!) because concurrency constructs are usually bolted on to an existing language with an entirely different semantic foundation. I will review some recent progress on designing better abstractions based on strong logical and type-theoretic principles. Multiple themes from functional and object-oriented programming will re-emerge from these foundations in a new form, including (ha!) shared memory.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n\n- Types for Dyadic Interaction by Kohei Honda\n- Language Primitives and Type Discipline for Structured Communication-Based Programming by Kohei Honda, Vasco Vasconcelos, and Makoto Kubo\n- Subtyping for Session Types in the Pi-Calculus by Simon Gay and Malcom Hole\n- Session Types and Intuitionistic Linear Propositions by Luís Caires and Frank Pfenning\n- Higher-Order Processes, Functions, and Sessions: a Monadic Integration by Bernardo Toninho, Luís Caires, and Frank Pfenning\nManifest Sharing with Session Types by Stephanie Balzer and Frank Pfenning\n\nBiography\n----------------\n\nFrank Pfenning (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/index.html) studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University Darmstadt and then left for Carnegie Mellon University on a Fulbright scholarship where he obtained his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1987 under the supervision of Professor Peter Andrews.\n\nHe subsequently joined the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University as research faculty where he became Professor in 2002 and served as Director of Graduate Programs from 2004 to 2008 and Associate Dean for Graduate Education from 2009 to 2010.

Back in 1986, it was used in the simulation of Jupiter’s atmosphere in the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey, and today its use is ubiquitous in the simulation of oceans, fires, and explosions in almost every blockbuster movie. In 1986, CFD required access to supercomputing facilities, but in 1999 Jos Stam published a highly influential paper, Stable Fluids, showing how to compute fluid simulations both easily and efficiently. A few years later, he was able to demonstrate a fluid simulation running on a handheld device at the SIGGRAPH conference, drawing gasps of astonishment from the audience. Many of the CFD techniques used in animation today have their roots in Stam’s paper and the relative simplicity of his approach has made the simulation of fluid phenomena accessible to a wide audience.\n\nIn this talk I will revisit Stam’s paper. I hope to give the audience a good idea of how they could implement a fluid simulation for themselves, just as Stam did for his audience back in 1999.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n\n- Stable Fluids by Jos Stam\n- Combining physical and visual simulation—creation of the planet Jupiter for the film “2010” by L.

These days, mobile phones are packed with multi core CPUs and even GPUs. Despite these advances in hardware, internet connections in most parts of the world are still surprisingly slow and unreliable. This creates a challenge: how can files be efficiently transferred between computers over a low-bandwidth, high latency network connection? In 1996, Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras developed a simple solution which powers one of the most useful UNIX tools, rsync. The algorithm remains relevant 21 years after its invention because it solves a timeless problem.\n\nThis talk will take you step by step through the rsync algorithm. You will learn that PhD theses are not always scary or unapproachable. Hopefully, you will also leave with a better intuition about the inner workings of rsync, as well as ideas for how its principles can be building blocks for solving many other different problems.\n\n\nBio\n-----\n\nCamilo Aguilar is a Software Engineer at Enigma (https://www.enigma.com/) and a founding member of Papers We Love Medellín (https://github.com/papers-we-love/medellin).

Using an auxiliary memory of m units (typically, \"short bytes\"), HyperLogLog performs a single pass over the data and produces an estimate of the cardinality such that the relative accuracy (the standard error) is typically about 1.04/√m. This improves on the best previously known cardinality estimator, LogLog, whose accuracy can be matched by consuming only 64% of the original memory. For instance, the new algorithm makes it possible to estimate cardinalities well beyond 10^9 with a typical accuracy of 2% while using a memory of only 1.5 kilobytes. The algorithm parallelizes optimally and adapts to the sliding window model.\n\nBio\n-----\n\nBen Linsay (http://blinsay.com/) (@blinsay (https://twitter.com/blinsay)) is somehow still a software engineer.

In 2016, the SCONE (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-arnautov.pdf) paper was written and presented at the USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi16). It outlined how to use Intel Secure Enclaves (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions) to guard containers against attack. Containers are built on the kernel primitives cgroups and namespaces with additional LSM (Linux Security Module) layers on top, such as AppArmor, SELinux, and seccomp. Intel SGX protects code from modification by using protected areas of memory known as enclaves. With containers and adoption of cloud on the rise, this paper continues to be on the cutting edge of what is to come. Some cloud providers are now starting to expose hardware specific features like GPU and SGX, which would make running containers with Intel's SGX trusted execution a reality in the cloud. With Intel's SGX, you can have a container's process shielded from access by other programs. We'll explore how realistic this is today and in the future as well as what benefits this would have to the security of containers.\n\nBio\n-----\nJessie Frazelle works with Linux and Containers at Microsoft.

Programmers have many useful intuitions about types, including what they are, what they have to offer, and how to think about and exploit them. Meanwhile, language theorists wrestle with these intuitions and work to make them even more precise: what in the world is a type? What is a type system? How can (and should) we formally reason about them?\n\nIn this talk, Ronald will unpack types and type systems from the perspectives of programming languages theorists, rather than practitioners. By spending quality time with some classic literature, we will see that formal theories about types and type systems have shifted back and forth and back again over time, depending on the challenges facing individual theorists, their conceptual stances, and the increasing sophistication and scope of types as part of language designs.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n* Types Are Not Sets by J.H.

Her specific obsession with the book was driven by translating the algorithms into something knittable, specifically making sure the outputs line up properly with knit stitches within a very low resolution pixel environment, which is what knitting is. (Her industrial knitting machine makes scarves at about 100 stitches/pixels wide, 1100 stitches/pixels long.) She'll delve into controlling very low resolutions with discrete algorithms while generating pleasing outputs. Using rewritten examples from modern scripting languages, Fabienne will also demonstrate the seashell pattern modeling algorithms. Finally, she'll dive into the knittability of the imagery with practical examples which have been manufactured on her own industrial knitting machine.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n* The Algorithmic Beauty of Seashells by Hans Meinhardt\n* Modeling seashells by D.

Further, PDF documents are used extensively in other publishing contexts, and are in many industries and roles the primary means of data interchange between organizations. Despite its ubiquity and the concordant importance of its file format and specification, the heritage and history of the PDF format and specification are not widely known and the engineering challenges and design choices it and its predecessors faced and made are rarely contemplated.\n\nIn this talk, Chas will provide a narrative history of PDF and its (immediate) predecessors — PostScript and Interpress — and explore the problem space of page description languages in general. Since these technologies were largely developed and promulgated from within commercial organizations, there are no papers per se to love, but Chas' narrative will be grounded in internally-published whitepapers that motivated the work, as well as decades-old public newsgroup postings from people involved at the time. The session will conclude with a brief tour through some of the internals of a couple of sample PDF documents, tying their concrete manifestation to the previously-discussed engineering challenges and design choices of the PDF specification.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n* PostScript and Interpress: a comparison by Reid, Brian (Newsgroup posting, March 1985)\n* The Camelot Project by Warnock, John. 1981\n\nBio\n-----\nChas Emerick is the founder of PDFDATA.io, the API for structured data extraction, where he is continuing a now 15-year-long history of building tools to usefully recover data from PDF documents.

In fact, the concept of continuations appears everywhere and is useful for everyone. In this talk, Kenichi will introduce delimited continuations from the programmer's perspective directly without requiring any program transformation or semantic arguments. He will then show how various and seemingly complex programs can be written simply and concisely by manipulating delimited continuations. The goal here is to convince you that delimited continuations are useful in day-to-day programming. Finally, Kenichi will speculate on the Curry-Howard isomorphism of delimited continuations, which could open the door for the introduction of delimited continuations into theorem proving.\n\nReferences\n------------------\n* Representing Control: A Study of CPS transformation by O.

He studied partial evaluation because it is the only general framework for compilation of reflective languages. He was attracted to delimited continuations because they explain various complex behavior of programming languages in a succinct and understandable manner. He is also interested in education of programming languages, because teaching forces us to think about the essence. He is a strong advocator of Design Recipe, which he believes is one of the essence of programming in general, and uses it to teach OCaml in the university. He ported the universe teachpack of Racket to OCaml, because it exhibits the essential model of game programming.\n\nRecently, he is co-developing an interactive OCaml type debugger as well as an OCaml stepper that uses delimited continuations in a non-trivial way.

In policy iteration, the algorithm alternates between two steps: 1) a policy evaluation step which, given the current policy, computes the state-action value function (commonly known as the Q-function) for the policy, and 2) a policy improvement step, which uses the Q-function to greedily improve the current policy. When the number of states and actions of the MDP is finite and small, policy iteration performs well and comes with nice theoretical guarantees. However, when the state and action spaces are large (possibly continuous), policy iteration becomes intractable, and approximate methods for solving MDPs must be used. \n\nLeast Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) is one method for approximately solving an MDP. The key idea here is to approximate the Q-function as a linear functional in a lifted, higher dimensional space, analogous to the idea of feature maps in supervised learning. Plugging this approximation into the Bellman equation gives a tractable linear system of equations to solve for the policy evaluation step. Furthermore, the policy improvement step remains the same as before.\n\nThis talk describes LSPI and some of its subtleties. One subtlety arises due to the fact that the Bellman operator is not necessarily invariant on our approximate function class, and hence an extra projection step is typically used to minimize the Bellman residual after projecting back on the function space. Furthermore, in order to build intuition for LSPI, I will also talk about what the LSPI algorithm does in the context of a well studied continuous optimal control problem known as the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).\n\nBio\n-----\nStephen Tu is a PhD student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley, studying problems in the intersection of optimization, control theory, and statistics.

Squier wrote \"Word problems and a homological finiteness condition for monoids,\" which proved a fascinating result that spawned an entire field, but which is little known outside of it. The great mathematical popularizer and category theorist John Baez sketched the ideas in 1995. We consider \"word problems,\" which ask the equality of two terms modulo a set of equivalences, restrict ourselves to simple objects called \"monoids\" that many functional programmers are fond of, and ask about the decidability of equality over them. This is the same as looking at strings and asking when they are equal if you consider mappings that equate some contiguous sequences with other contiguous sequences. (Such problems arise ubiquitously in interesting computational problems -- consider for example the equivalence of sequences of patches, or of edit actions across a distributed system). The way computer scientists would think to answer this is to see if you can rewrite both sides of the equation into a single canonical form that you can compare for equality. Indeed, that's what Don Knuth and Peter Bendix did, and the result is the Knuth-Bendix algorithm, used in theorem provers and many other applications. \n\nBut just how universal is the Knuth-Bendix algorithm? Well, Squier showed that there are finite monoids with decidable word problems that cannot be turned into such canonical rewrite procedures as Knuth-Bendix gives us. And furthermore, he showed that this result derives from considering our systems using the tools of modern algebraic topology! In particular, he showed how to calculate a homology of a monoid presentation.  \n\nEver since then, people have been seeking to generalize Squier's result in new and exciting ways. One of the niftiest and newest was presented last year at FSCD, this talk's paper, which I love, but do not claim to fully understand. Instead of a monoid, we consider an arbitrary \"algebraic theory\" (say, a syntax tree of a programming language with some equalities between certain forms of trees). And we now ask not about the word problem, but just the minimum number of equalities necessary to present such a theory. The answer, which can be computed with an algorithm, comes from even more, and more generalized homology.  The purpose of this talk is to make the above understandable to a lay audience, to sketch some idea of how to think about things that arise in computer science topologically, and to provide an invitation to basic notions of homology.\n\nBio\n-----\nGershom Bazerman is a software developer in New York.

Reinforcement-based learning algorithms such as contextual bandits can be very effective in these settings, but applying them in practice is fraught with technical debt, and no general system exists that supports them completely. We address this and create the first general system for contextual learning, called the Decision Service. Existing systems often suffer from technical debt that arises from issues like incorrect data collection and weak debuggability, issues we systematically address through our ML methodology and system abstractions. The Decision Service enables all aspects of contextual bandit learning using four system abstractions which connect together in a loop: explore (the decision space), log, learn, and deploy. Notably, our new explore and log abstractions ensure the system produces correct, unbiased data, which our learner uses for online learning and to enable real-time safeguards, all in a fully reproducible manner. \n\nThe Decision Service has a simple user interface and works with a variety of applications: we present two live production deployments for content recommendation that achieved click-through improvements of 25-30%, another with 18% revenue lift in the landing page, and ongoing applications in tech support and machine failure handling. The service makes real-time decisions and learns continuously and scalably, while significantly lowering technical debt. \n\nBio\n-----\nJohn Langford is a machine learning research scientist, a field which he says \"is shifting from an academic discipline to an industrial tool\".

Failure detectors are central to the way we think about consensus algorithms. In a fully asynchronous system, the FLP impossibility result (https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf) shows that no consensus solution that can tolerate crash failures exists! This simple, stunning result imposed a hard constraint on what could be solved in an asynchronous model.\n\nThe FLP (http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/) result kicked off a flurry of research into ways to circumvent the impossibility result. Failure detectors were the most compelling abstraction proposed. These augmented the asynchronous model just enough to allow consensus, while retaining most of the neat abstractions that make asynchronous systems simple to reason about.\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss some of the history and background of Chandra and Toueg's failure detector proposal (http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf), and discuss some failure detector mechanisms that followed the paper.\n\nBio\n-----\nKiran (https://kiranbot.com) (@kiranb) is a software engineer at Stripe.

You probably have some intuition for doing this already, but explaining it or convincing someone of the difference between a good modularization and a bad one can be difficult. This 1971 paper by David Parnas argues for using information-hiding as the basis for evaluating modularizations.

In addition, the information content of a program is spread over several different layers of abstraction. Superficially (and in our typical mode of interaction with an editor) a program is a sequence of characters, where its syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and apobetic layers lay latent under deeper layers of abstraction.\n\nEpitaxis is a language independent system designed to reify these layers of abstraction so they can be queried and reasoned over to allow software to be dealt with at the appropriate level of abstraction. In an analogous way that programs are used to model other systems, Epitaxis models software to allow access to its lexical, syntactic, and semantic layers, exposing execution state space to search and automated reasoning. In addition to funding bugs and aiding in understanding complex software this platform can be used to do machine learning over execution state space, and possibly a virtual environment for a machine agent to learn and explore software.\n\nPaper: http://files.meetup.com/18381002/EPITAXIS%20ASystemForSyntacticAndSemanticSoftwareQueriesUsingDeduc.pdf\n\nSlides: http://files.meetup.com/18381002/Epitaxis.pdf","published_at":"2016-10-03 20:45:44.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M0Zv-_PT9-M/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT1H34M36S","view_count":267,"like_count":4,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"","category_id":"28","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:08.606014Z","updated_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:08.606014Z"},

In reality, this bland terms covers a wide range of creative practices, all based on the use of code and algorithms as both pragmatic tools and creative materials in their own right. From generative visuals based on math, to custom data visualizations and architectural designs articulated as parametric systems, the description of aesthetic ideas as software systems has enabled a new creative paradigm based on computation.\n\nBut no new paradigm is without its birth pains. The encoding of human creativity into machine readable code is hardly a trivial task, potentially restricting expression as much as it enables creation. Even more insidious is the seductiveness of certain algorithms, producing compelling forms with a minimum of creative input. Creatives are no less prone to God Complex than your average computer scientist, with the added layer of being guilty of cliché. What are the critical criteria that one might apply to a software system, anyway?\n\nAn informal survey of current trends, concerns and facepalms, this presentation will discuss possible critiques of creative code. Through examples I will demonstrate the power of computation as a creative tool, along with some of the pitfalls that come with it. Finally, I will discuss my subjective suggestions for some best practices when creating with algorithms.\n\nThis talk follows up ideas from a controversial 2012 blog post titled \"The Algorithm Thought Police\", followed up in at a talk at the Eyeo Festival in Minneapolis the same year.\n\nReferenced Papers\n------------------------------\nThe Algorithm Thought Police | http://mariuswatz.com/mwatztumblrcom/the-algorithm-thought-police.html\nRE: The Algorithm Thought Police | http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=2262\nAlgorithm Critique and Computational Aesthetics | https://vimeo.com/46903693\nVoronoi Diagrams | http://www.pi6.fernuni-hagen.de/downloads/publ/tr198.pdf\n\nBio\n-----\nMarius Watz (NO) is an artist working with visual abstraction through generative software processes.

The past eight years have seen a rapid expansion of techniques proposed and evaluated in this space.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss the progression of the area of automated bug repair in particular. I will especially focus on the key challenge of assuring, measuring, and reasoning about the quality of bug-fixing patches. Most such techniques, whether heuristic or semantic, rely on test cases to validate transformation correctness, in the absence of formal correctness specifications, but otherwise vary in the way they construct candidate patches and traverse the infinite space of possibilities. I will outline recent results on the relationship between test suite quality and origin and output quality, with observations about both semantic and heuristic approaches. I will conclude with a discussion of potentially promising future directions and open questions.\n\nReferenced Papers\n------------------------------\n- Automatic Program Repair with Evolutionary Computation | https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/p109-weimer.pdf\n- Angelix: scalable multiline program patch synthesis via symbolic analysis | https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/ICSE16-angelix.pdf\n- Repairing Programs with Semantic Code Search | http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/pubs/pubs/Ke15ase.pdf\n\nBio\n-----\nClaire Le Goues is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, primarily affiliated with the Institute for Software Research.

If we consider context-free grammars as recursive regular expressions, Brzozowski's equational theory extends without modification to context-free grammars (and it generalizes to parser combinators). The supporting actors in this story are three concepts familiar to functional programmers - laziness, memoization and fixed points; these allow Brzozowski's original equations to be transliterated into purely functional code in about 30 lines spread over three functions.\n\nYet, this almost impossibly brief implementation has a drawback: its performance is sour - in both theory and practice. The culprit? Each derivative can double the size of a grammar, and with it, the cost of the next derivative.\n\nFortunately, much of the new structure inflicted by the derivative is either dead on arrival, or it dies after the very next derivative. To eliminate it, we once again exploit laziness and memoization to transliterate an equational theory that prunes such debris into working code.

CR has been widely used in both commercial systems and academic research prototypes. In so doing, various shortcomings of the original CR protocol have come to light. In this talk, I will summarize these findings and present a new version of CR that addresses the shortcomings.  Our improved CR protocol supports different consistency guarantees, avoids the tail bottleneck for reads, and introduces autonomous reconfiguration of the system without requiring an external master. Additionally, we have developed a formal end-to-end specification of the protocol, including the actions of clients, detailing reconfiguration and linearizable execution of client requests. Through this specification, we are able to reason about the new protocol more precisely and implement the protocol effortlessly.  Lastly, I will contrast our approach to the related work.\n\nBio\n-----\nDeniz Altınbüken  is a Ph.D. candidate in Distributed Systems at Cornell University, working with Robbert van Renesse.

Many who haven’t read it, use (and basically understand) the fundamental idea of logical clocks, and their progeny (vector clocks, matrix clocks, etc.). More than a few understand the current state of the art: dotted version vectors and bounded version vectors. Paradoxically, almost everyone missed some of the more subtle concepts, and questions that Lamport introduced in this paper.\n\nIn the intervening years. Progress has occurred, and the state of the art has evolved. This talk is therefore in three parts. The first being a review of the paper itself, the concepts it introduced, and the assumptions behind these concepts. The second part reflects what we’ve learned in the intervening years, and especially the relationship of Lamport’s (original) understanding of time, which was superior to almost all other computer scientists at the time, and what (in contrast) we know now. The third part will be entirely devoted to questions and answers: Where anyone can ask a question, and anyone can try to answer it. The speaker will try to answer the question if no one else wants to, or if the audience appears dissatisfied. The discussion is expected to be lively, insightful, and potentially, mind blowing.\n\nIn order to prepare yourself for this talk. Anticipate there will come a point where you are asked to take a blue pill vs. a red pill.  If you watch these videos, your red pill transition will be gentler.  Most of you may prefer to take the blue pill and go back to your old way of thinking about time. In which case, you won’t find this talk very interesting, because of course you already know all the answers.\n\nThose who want to be more prepared for the red/blue pill experience, will benefit from both reading the paper, and watching the most recent PBS videos on the nature of spacetime:\n\n1.

His recent (March 2014) paper, ‘Propositions as Types,’ is his survey of the relationship between propositions, as in mathematical logic, and types, as in statically-typed programming language. Together, we’ll explore how and why this relationship is broad, deep, and mysterious; how it may shape new and future programming languages and possibly affect STEM education; and maybe even shed a little light (and hopefully a little less heat) on why some users of statically-typed languages are so adamant about it. \n\n\n\nPaul Snively is an architect for Verizon OnCue, working in Scala in a purely functional fashion.

Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. In environments with a more complex management model, with delegation of some management functions to parties under varying degrees of trust, the base UNIX model and most natural extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually untrusting parties are introduced, \"inappropriate\" rapidly transitions to\"nightmarish\", especially with regards to data integrity and privacy protection. The FreeBSD \"Jail\" facility provides the ability to partition the operating system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the UNIX \"root\" model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popular thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments. \n\nSolaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads \n================================================\nServer consolidation, which allows multiple workloads to run on the same system, has become increasingly important as a way to improve the utilization of computing resources and reduce costs. Consolidation is common in mainframe environments, where technology to support running multiple workloads and even multiple operating systems on the same hardware has been evolving since the late 1960’s. This technology is now becoming an important differentiator in the UNIX and Linux server market as well, both at the low end (virtual web hosting) and high end(traditional data center server consolidation).This paper introduces Solaris Zones (zones), a fully realized solution for server consolidation projects in a commercial UNIX operating system. By creating virtualized application execution environments within a single instance of the operating system, the facility strikes a unique balance between competing requirements. On the one hand, a system with multiple workloads needs to run those workloads in isolation, to ensure that applications can neither observe data from other applications nor affect their operation. It must also prevent applications from over-consuming system resources. On the other hand, the system as a whole has to be flexible, manageable, and observable, in order to reduce administrative costs and increase efficiency. By focusing on the support of multiple application environments rather than multiple operating system instances, zones meets isolation requirements without sacrificing manageability. \n\nBio\n-----\nBryan Cantrill (@bcantrill) is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide development of the SmartOS and SmartDataCenter platforms, and the Node.js platform.

Lest however, you be consumed by an unshakable hopelessness that, as an industry, we are bound to Santayana’s Sisyphean prophesy (‘those who don’t learn from history are bound to repeat it’), I will show that Brooks’ theories are alive, well and in fact thriving in niche communities paving our way forward. \n\n\n\nAbout Bill:\n\nIn a previous life, Bill (@williamberryiii) crafted scenery for Broadway, a la Pirates of Penzance, but now crafts software for the enterprise, a la Pirates of Silicon Valley.

While on the surface it's all about how to make operating systems scale, it's also a story about how the same researchers can tackle a problem from different angles, succeed each time, and yet end up with very different conclusions. \n\nAt OSDI '08 Silas Boyd-Swicker et al published Corey: An Operating system for Many Cores, which advocated for a fundamental restructuring of the operating system; they observed that scalability problems often manifest because of data unintentionally shared between CPUs, so their research OS provided improved abstractions for programmers to inform the kernel about what is supposed to be local to a particular core or thread.\n\nAt the subsequent OSDI, though, the same research lab published an analysis of Linux scalability to many cores, where they present the same problem -- kernel scalability-- but instead tackled it by finding individual bottlenecks and implementing tiny point fixes, mostly-hidden from application code.  This inverted approach worked so well that in their abstract they arguably recanted the conclusion from their earlier work: \"...there is no scalability reason to give up on traditional OS organizations yet.\"\n\nThese papers, together, are interesting to me for a bunch of reasons.  The former advocates for better application control of data sharing by exposing new abstraction primitives, whereas the OS remains in the latter paper an opaque layer where we're to be mostly content at not having to look underneath the hood.  Seeing two seemingly opposing philosophies work equally well was a surprising result to me.  It's also interesting how the tacit assumptions we make can cause wildly different systems to be built.  In one, it's treated as axiomatic that a new software architecture is needed, whereas in the other the very first sentence questions the \"traditional architectures don't scale\" assumption.  And, of course, when so many people build careers out of asserting that There's Only One Way To Solve This Problem, it's refreshing to see the same group of researchers try different approaches in such quick succession.\n\n\n\nNathan's Bio\n\nNathan is currently working on low-latency content distribution at Fastly and has previously hacked on improving the performance of language runtimes and OS hypervisors.

But, what's the reason for so many systems choosing alternative techniques such as quorum-based or state machine replication? In this talk, we talk through a history of chain replication, starting with the original work from 2004 by van Renesse and Schneider. We will look at the various systems built using chain replication: Hibari, FAWN-KV, and CRAQ. We'll explore safer designs of chain replication, such as the elastic replication work in 2013, and finally look a new and unique designs of chain replication, such as Basho's Machi system.  \n\nThe papers discussed in Chris's talk are:\n\n• Object Storage on CRAQ - https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf \n\n• FAWN: A Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes - http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf\n\n• Chain Replication in Theory and in Practice - http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf \n\n• HyperDex: A Distributed, Searchable Key-Value Store - http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf \n\n• ChainReaction: a Causal+ ConsistentDatastore based on Chain Replication - http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf \n\n• Leveraging Sharding in the Design ofScalable Replication Protocols - http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf \n\n\n\nChris's Bio\n\nChristopher Meiklejohn is a Senior Software Engineer with Machine Zone, Inc. working on distributed systems.

These methods work via access to a kernel function, which can be thought of as a measure of similarity between two vectors. The standard method of optimization via kernels requires solving a program with decision variable the size of the number of data points. As dataset sizes grow, this becomes prohibitive.\n\nThis paper addresses this issue in a surprisingly practical way. Specifically, the authors show that by using a multiple of d random projections based on the Fourier transform of the kernel function (where d is the ambient dimension), one can accurately approximate the kernel function. This allows practitioners to use fast linear solvers and retain the benefits of more expressive function classes.\n\nStephen is a graduate student in EECS at UC Berkeley.\n\n\n\nMain talk\n\nJason Brown on the Epidemic Algorithms for Replicated Database Maintenance paper (http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/CSL-89-1_Epidemic_Algorithms_for_Replicated_Database_Maintenance.pdf). \n\nFrom Jason: \"While published in 1987, 'Epidemic Algorithms for Replicated Database Maintenance' describes an early distributed system that uses gossip replication and eventual consistency (the latter uncannily like modern NoSQL databases). \n\nThe subject of gossip branched into some interesting directions since the '80s, I'll primarily concentrate on the Demers paper, give a brief survey of the gossip literature, and tie those papers into some modern, well-known systems (namely, Cassandra and Riak).\" \n\nJason Brown is a Senior Software Engineer at Apple, as well as being an Apache Cassandra Committer.

Realizing this phenomenon had not been discussed by psychologists of the day, he set out to describe his observations using the classical formalization of Buridan's ass. Lamport initially failed to have this paper published in various scientific journals, being rejected on grounds of superficiality. It wasn't until 2011, when a reader suggested he resubmit to Foundations of Physics, that the paper was eventually published.\n\nThose familiar with the works of Lamport know him as a logician, his life's work has pushed forward the state of the art in areas of mutual exclusion and distributed systems probably more than any other, and so reading Buridan's Principle might strike us as a bit odd, or even obscure. We're in unfamiliar territory with Lamport. Nonetheless, in this paper, Lamport's casual observations lead him to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences, providing us readers with what appears to be a universal law of nature: Buridan's Principle. \n\n[0] http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf\n\nBio\n-----\nTom Santero (@tsantero) is a Software Engineer at Helium Systems, writing Haskell and Erlang to connect things to the internet.

Finally, a breakthrough came by sharing ideas from category theory to bring monads into functional programming, as a way to model and manage side effects. However, little has been done to ensure that entire interaction sequences make sense. For example, many functional programming languages will allow you to open a file handle, close it, and then try and read from it - clearly a nonsensical sequence of operations! In \"Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune\", Conor McBride shows us how we can borrow more ideas from the literature, introducing a new formulation of indexed monads - a structure with close connections to slice categories. Given these new tools, he demonstrates that these monads can correspond to enforcing logical properties - following in the tradition of propositions-as-types, we now have the ability to begin to encode Hoare logic pre- and post-conditions on our programs. \n\nAbout Oliver:\n\nOllie has always had an interest in functional programming and correctness from a very early age - puzzled by how easy it seemed to make things go wrong, even by accident!

I’ll present the work of one of the more extreme (and interesting!) philosophers of science, Paul Feyerabend. In “Against Method”, Feyerabend looks at the history of science and finds that there is no fixed scientific methodology and the only methodology that can encompass the rich history is ‘anything goes’. We see (not only computer) science as a perfect methodology for building correct knowledge, but is this really the case? To quote Feyerabend: \n\n\"Science is much more 'sloppy' and 'irrational' than its methodological image.\"\n\nI’ll be mostly talking about Paul Feyerabend’s “Against Method”, but as a computer scientist myself, I’ll insert a number of examples based on my experience with theoretical programming language research.

Software has traditionally been constructed according to the principle that a module should expose its functionality but hide its implementation. This principle, informally known as black-box abstraction, is a basic tenet of software design, underlying our approaches to portability, reuse,and many other important issues in computing. However, in some cases black-box abstraction causes the very problems it is supposed to eliminate.\n\nAs a programming languages becomes higher and higher level, its implementation in terms of the underlying machines involves more and more trade-offs on the part of the implementer, about what cases to optimize at the expense of other cases. This leaves a programmer victim to inefficiencies driving them to break language abstractions and \"code between the lines\" making code more complex and less portable.\n\nMeta-object protocols are a principled way of getting the most out of abstraction. It is a way to allow the end-programmer to go back and remake design tradeoffs to better suite their needs. In addition Meta-object protocols are an extremely fascinating and elegant formalism.\n\n---\n\nThanks again to Brainium for being such a wonderful sponsor of our meetup \n\nmeetup: http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-LA/events/225395217/\npaper: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~vahdat/papers/mop.pdf","published_at":"2015-10-03 03:48:10.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SurLTjq53Og/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT1H6M","view_count":867,"like_count":14,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"","category_id":"28","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:11.420756Z","updated_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:11.420756Z"},

Most concurrent software (developed in low-level languages) still relies on error-prone and unscalable memory management techniques for correctness despite the introduction of superior methods over 30 years ago. Safe memory reclamation allows for performant and robust memory management that is also suitable for advanced concurrent programming techniques such as non-blocking synchronization. If properly used, safe memory reclamation techniques allow improved performance and simplicity without the complexity of full-blown garbage collection.\n\nThis paper provides a terrific overview of common safe memory reclamation mechanisms and then explores their performance implications. In this talk, I will do the same but with stronger emphasis on the introductory aspects of safe memory reclamation and contrast with a refreshed performance analysis. \n\nBio\n-----\nSamy Al Bahra (@0xf390) is the co-founder of Backtrace, where he is helping build a modern debugging platform for today's complex applications.

Reasoning about concurrent code is difficult; but it's also very hard to understand whether your design has latent scalability bottlenecks until you can actually run it on many cores.  And what if the problem is in your interface, instead of just the implementation?\n\nThis paper presents a simple, elegant rule:  whenever interface operations commute, they can be implemented in a way that scales.   \n\nThe authors apply this idea to Linux, and create a new operating system by using the rule, sv6.  Their paper also comes with software, COMMUTER, which can help developers evaluate their interfaces to find opportunities for scaling.\n\nThis is a very powerful idea, and probably has applications in other areas like distributed systems.

As programs have grown in size and complexity, so have the systems that manage garbage collection. Each algorithm makes a different set of tradeoffs between factors such as the space used by objects, the space used by bookkeeping, the number of unused objects (garbage) that remain uncollected, the time spent in allocation, and the time spent in \ncollection. \n\nThe Train Algorithm is an incremental generational garbage collector that was designed to deal with the long and unpredictable pause times caused by other algorithms. It does this by grouping objects together on \"cars\" in \"trains\". The algorithm provides a strategy for moving objects from the younger generation into different cars, moving objects from one car to another, and collecting cars and trains. It was first described by Hudson and Moss in the paper \"Incremental \nCollection of Mature Objects\". \n\nIn their paper \"Incremental Mature Garbage Collection Using the Train Algorithm,\" Seligmann and Grarup describe what they believe is the first implementation of the Train Algorithm, which they used to replace the traditional mark-and-sweep collector that was used in the BETA programming language. They discuss their implementation and present information about the performance characteristics of the new algorithm as compared to the original.\n\nBio\n----\nAndrew Turley (@casio_juarez) is a lead software engineer on the platform team at TheLadders, where he builds infrastructure by linking Storm topologies together using RabbitMQ.

This paper, on Google's Chubby lock service, is the story of happens when a system stops being a polite theory, and starts getting real-world use.\n\nTo anyone who has worked in depth as a distributed systems engineer, Chubby is a beautiful paper. It is not a paper about algorithms and their limits, or a toy fringe system created by grad students to test a hypothesis. It is a paper that describes the real tradeoffs that real systems engineers make when designing something to solve a large set of problems well enough. This paper shows the key insights that the authors had as to how such a system might be used, and awareness of what it should do well, and what it should not try to do well. It details how Chubby was designed, but then goes further to describe how it ended up being used when released to the wild, and the surprises and consequences of these design decisions.\n\nBio\n----\nCamille Fournier (@skamille) is the CTO at Rent the Runway.

Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.\n\nA single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas. I will talk about my personal experience using Hoare logic to verify memory guarantees in an operating system. I will also discuss takeaway lessons for working programmers.\n\nBio\n----\nJean Yang (@jeanqasaur) is a final-year PhD student at MIT.

Either the paper is foundational, siring a lineage of important research, or the paper is useful, guiding readers toward clever optimizations, fault-tolerant solutions, and non-intuitive hacks. \"The Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts\" is neither. Only a few papers build on McBride's work and the conclusions of the paper, though promising, haven't yet found any real employ.\n\nThis paper is lovable, fun, and important because it is a radical thought experiment in the limits of abstraction. The paper poses the question: we call data types \"algebraic\", so can we \"do calculus\" on them? Surely, the nomenclature is just coincidental? What would it even mean to take the derivative of a data type? The paper stretches algebraic data types to what should be their breaking point and then demonstrates that it's not a breaking point ay all. By considering the paper's set-up and implications, we gain a deeper understanding of types and what they abstract. \n\nAs it will turn out, you can take the derivative of data type and the result is meaningful. The derivative of an algebraic type is another data type, namely the type that can represent any specific context in the original type, any position in the original structure. This relationship is eerily similar to the relationship of functions to their derivatives (roughly, the contextual rate of change) that we all learned in high school. \n\n• No previous knowledge of calculus, algebraic data types, zippers, contexts or anything else is required.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n- What is an algebraic data type? \n\n- What is a zipper and its sister structure, the one-hole context?\n\n- How can we derive a one-hole context from any given type? (How can we represent a specific location in an arbitrarily complex tree, type, etc)\n\n- What are the one-hole contexts of common types: the list, the binary tree, the ternary tree, and the rose tree?\n\n- Why would anyone care?","published_at":"2014-09-14 08:01:57.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7tQsKxC2I8/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT1H6M26S","view_count":1972,"like_count":42,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"Papers (Software),Computer Science (Field Of Study),papers_we_love,paperswelove,derivatives,polymorphic_types,zippers,datatypes","category_id":"24","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:14.037297Z","updated_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:14.037297Z"},

This enables language designers to focus on features without worrying about the complexities of compiler optimizations and code generation. This paper presents a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that allows the application to control the JIT compiler behavior at runtime. We'll discuss how various programming languages can take advantage of this framework.\n\nTo intrigue compiler aficionados, the authors show how combining AST node rewriting during interpretation, optimization, and deoptimization produces high performance code from the interpreter without a language-specific compiler. In addition, they present how features of a variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, R and others, map on the framework.","published_at":"2014-09-14 07:49:06.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L3e8G5l9gT8/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT1H15M1S","view_count":1756,"like_count":26,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"Papers (Software),paperswelove,papers_we_love,Virtual Machine (Software Genre),Computer Science (Field Of Study),Interpreters vs Compilers","category_id":"24","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:14.038282Z","updated_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:14.038282Z"},

We're all familiar with routing problems, such as the recent RapGenius incident. It turns out that simple improvements to randomized routing can dramatically improve the performance! Sparrow is a distributed scheduling algorithm for low latency, high throughput workloads. We'll review the Sparrow algorithm, and learn the tricks that they used. Then, we'll discuss other applications of Sparrow, besides the big-data map-reduce application it was created for.","published_at":"2014-06-18 09:06:23.000000Z","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rTTVSUw1wio/hqdefault.jpg","duration":"PT56M21S","view_count":620,"like_count":1,"comment_count":0,"channel_title":"PapersWeLove","tags":"sparrow,Distributed Computing (Conference Subject),distributed_systems,scheduling,Computer Science (Field Of Study),Papers (Software),papers_we_love,paperswelove","category_id":"24","created_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:14.040501Z","updated_at":"2026-01-19 18:53:14.040501Z"},
