In this work, we empirically investigate modern ORM-backed applications’ use and disuse of database concurrency control mechanisms. Specifically, we focus our study on the common use of feral, or application-level, mechanisms for maintaining database integrity, which, across a range of ORM systems, often take the form of declarative correctness criteria, or invariants. We quantitatively analyze the use of these mechanisms in a range of open source applications written using the Ruby on Rails ORM and find that feral invariants are the most popular means of ensuring integrity (and, by usage, are over 37 times more popular than transactions). We evaluate which of these feral invariants actually ensure integrity (by usage, up to 86.9%) and which—due to concurrency errors and lack of database support—may lead to data corruption (the remainder), which we experimentally quantify. In light of these findings, we present recommendations for database system designers for better supporting these modern ORM programming patterns, thus eliminating their adverse effects on application integrity.</p> <p><br/><b>Paper Link</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bailis.org/papers/feral-sigmod2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.bailis.org/papers/feral-sigmod2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bailis.org/papers/feral-sigmod2015.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>The Morning Paper Discussion</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/09/04/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity/\"><a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/09/04/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity/\" class=\"linkified\">https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/09/04/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity/</a></a></p> <p><b>SIGMOD '15 Presentation</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pbailis/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity\"><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pbailis/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity\" class=\"linkified\">https://speakerdeck.com/pbailis/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity</a></a></p> <p><b>Caitie McCaffrey's Distributed Sagas Talk</b></p> <p>This is what inspired us to discuss the paper:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0</a></a></p> <p>I hope to see you there!</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.60566711425781,"address1":"1000 2nd Ave #1000","address2":null,"name":"Comcast Technology Solutions","postalCode":"","lon":-122.3351058959961,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1501723800000,"title":"PWL #34: Feral Concurrency Control"},"229471493":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/229471493/","description":"<p>Y'all have called my bluff, we're talking about CRDTs!

Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time.</p> <p>In this paper we present Dedalus, a foundation language for programming and reasoning about distributed systems. Dedalus reduces to a subset of Datalog with negation, aggregate functions, successor and choice, and adds an explicit notion of logical time to the language. We show that Dedalus provides a declarative foundation for the two signature features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous processing and communication. Given these two features, we address two important properties of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of safety appropriate to non-terminating computations, and stratified monotonic reasoning with negation over time. We also provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal notions of safety and stratification. Our experience implementing full-featured systems in variants of Datalog suggests that Dedalus is well-suited to the specification of rich distributed services and protocols, and provides both cleaner semantics and richer tests of correctness.</p> <p>Tech Report version: <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html\"><a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html</a></a><br/>Published version: <a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf\"><a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Earlier work:</p> <p>Overlog - <a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/netdb-09/\"><a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/netdb-09/\" class=\"linkified\">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/netdb-09/</a></a></p> <p>Related work:<br/>Bloom - <a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/\"><a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bloom-lang.net/</a></a></p> <p>The CALM and CRON Conjectures (which have since been proven): <a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/\"><a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/</a></a> (I recommend the keynote talk and paper, \"The Declarative Imperative\" which introduced the CALM and CRON conjectures.)</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1436491800000,"title":"PWL#9: Dedalus: Datalog in Time and Space"},"248119134":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/248119134/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>PWL mini:<br/>David Murray presents NL2Bash: A Corpus and Semantic Parser for Natural Language Interface to the Linux Operating System<br/>(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08979.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08979.pdf</a>)<br/>\"We present new data and semantic parsing methods for the problem of mapping English sentences to Bash commands (NL2Bash).

However, similar abstractions do not exist for storing and accessing metadata. To fill this gap, Tango provides developers with the abstraction of a replicated, in-memory data structure (such as a map or a tree) backed by a shared log. Tango objects are easy to build and use, replicating state via simple append and read operations on the shared log instead of complex distributed protocols; in the process, they obtain properties such as linearizability, persistence and high availability from the shared log. Tango also leverages the shared log to enable fast transactions across different objects, allowing applications to partition state across machines and scale to the limits of the underlying log without sacrificing consistency.<br/>```</p> <p><b>Where is this going down?</b><br/>Thanks to Whitepages for hosting! Enter the building through the doors on 4th Ave, and head for the elevators in the southwest corner of the building.

The paper is titled: \"<b>The Dataflow Model: A Practical Approach to Balancing Correctness, Latency, and Cost in Massive-Scale, Unbounded, Out-of-Order Data Processing</b>\". This presents the state of the art in stream processing systems at scale and are also the technologies that lie at the heart of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/what-is-google-cloud-dataflow\">Google Cloud Dataflow</a>.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Unbounded, unordered, global-scale datasets are increasingly common in day-to-day business (e.g. Web logs, mobile usage statistics, and sensor networks). At the same time, consumers of these datasets have evolved sophisticated requirements, such as event-time ordering and windowing by features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable hunger for faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates that one can never fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost for these types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are left with the quandary of how to reconcile the tensions between these seemingly competing propositions, often resulting in disparate implementations and systems. We propose that a fundamental shift of approach is necessary to deal with these evolved requirements in modern data processing. We as a field must stop trying to groom unbounded datasets into finite pools of information that eventually become complete, and instead live and breathe under the assumption that we will never know if or when we have seen all of our data, only that new data will arrive, old data may be retracted, and the only way to make this problem tractable is via principled abstractions that allow the practitioner the choice of appropriate tradeoffs along the axes of interest: correctness, latency, and cost. In this paper, we present one such approach, the Dataflow Model, along with a detailed examination of the semantics it enables, an overview of the core principles that guided its design, and a validation of the model itself via the real-world experiences that led to its development.</p> <p><br/><b>Papers:</b></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf\">The Dataflow Model: A Practical Approach to Balancing Correctness, Latency, and Cost in Massive-Scale, Unbounded, Out-of-Order Data Processing</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41378.pdf\">MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1452825000000,"title":"PWL #15: The Dataflow Model and Millwheel: Fault tolerant stream processing"},"244676637":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/244676637/","description":"<p>PWL Mini:<br/>Ankur Chauhan presents \"LittleTable: A Time-Series Database and Its Uses\"<br/>(<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056102\" class=\"linkified\">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056102</a>)</p> <p>\"We present LittleTable, a relational database that Cisco Meraki has used since 2008 to store usage statistics, event logs, and other time-series data from our customers’ devices.

Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products.

Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier</a>.</p> <p>\"Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.

As applications scale up in user base, they often face challenges responding quickly enough to the high volume of requests. A common aid is caching of database results in the application’s memory space, taking advantage of program-specific knowledge of which caching schemes are sound and useful, embodied in handwritten modifications that make the program less maintainable. These modifications also require nontrivial reasoning about the read-write dependencies across operations. In this paper, we present a compiler optimization that automatically adds sound SQL caching to Web applications coded in the Ur/Web domain-specific functional language, with no modifications required to source code.\"</p> <p><br/><b>Who What Where?<br/></b><br/>Big ups to <a href=\"http://thomasstreet.com/\">Thomas Street</a> for hosting!

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon’s core services use to provide an “always-on” experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.  </p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/fall2009/dynamo.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/fall2009/dynamo.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/fall2009/dynamo.pdf</a></a><br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>NOTE: We are still looking for a venue for this event.

Throughput, availability, and several objectplacement strategies (including schemes based on distributed hash table routing) are discussed.</p> <p><br/>Link to the paper: <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/osdi04.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/osdi04.pdf</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1434072600000,"title":"PWL#8: Chain Replication for Supporting High Throughput and Availability"},"224064458":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/224064458/","description":"<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present Mesos, a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale to 50,000 (emulated) nodes, and is resilient to failures.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Presenter:</b></p> <p>Ankur Chauhan</p> <p><b>Links:</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf\"><a href=\"https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org\"><a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://mesos.apache.org</a></a></p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-frameworks/\">List of Mesos Frameworks</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1439517600000,"title":"Mesos - A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center"},"228753723":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/228753723/","description":"<p>Fuzzing is a technique to find software defects by providing random(ish) input to a system, and watching to see which patterns of input cause bad behavior.</p> <p>The paper is \"Fuzzing: The State of the Art\", available here: <br/><a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a558209.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a558209.pdf</a></p> <p>The talk will go over the history of fuzzing, different methods of fuzzing, and how fuzzing can be applicable to your everyday life.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1457663400000,"title":"PWL #17: Fuzzing: The State of the Art"},"226493450":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/226493450/","description":"<p>Trevor Lalish-Menagh will present \"A Critique of the CAP Theorem.\" Abstract:</p> <p>The CAP Theorem is a frequently cited impossibility result in distributed systems, especially among NoSQL distributed databases. In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a \"delay-sensitivity\" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network faults.</p> <p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393\" class=\"linkified\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1449801000000,"title":"PWL #14: A Critique of the CAP Theorem"},"227211670":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/227211670/","description":"<p>Tristan Penman will present Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications.</p> <p>\"A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex- periments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf\"><a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf</a></a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1455244200000,"title":"PWL #16: Chord"},"209319592":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/209319592/","description":"<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Immutable vectors are a convenient data structure for functional programming and part of the standard library of modern languages like Clojure and Scala.

However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically. Thus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specific insights that video quality is typically determined by a small subset of critical features whose criticality persists over several tens of minutes. This enables a scalable and accurate workflow where we automatically learn critical features for different sessions on coarse-grained timescales, while updating quality predictions in near real-time. Using a combination of a real-world pilot deployment and trace-driven analysis, we demonstrate that CFA leads to significant improvements in video quality; e.g., 32% less buffering time and 12% higher bitrate than a random decision maker.</p> <p>Paper: <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf\"><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\nPresenter: Ankur Chauhan (Sr Software Engineer, Brightcove Inc.)</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1463103000000,"title":"PWL #19: CFA: A Practical Prediction System for Video QoE Optimization"},"235992744":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/235992744/","description":"<p><b>The Main Event<br/></b>David Murray presents <a href=\"https://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/diffie.hellman.pdf\">New Directions in Cryptography</a> and <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf\">A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems</a>.</p> <p>These two classic papers are big favorites of mine.
