It's got everything in there: People over Process, No Single Process, even a preference for knowledge in developer's heads over \"knowledge\" represented in documentation &amp; manuals.</p> <p>I'll be recapping the paper briefly and discuss what a \"Theory of a Program\" is. I'll then move onto talking about the parallels between Naur's Theories and Kuhn's (whom Naur invokes in the paper) notion of Paradigm in traditional science. I'll end by discussing how this paper influenced the Agile movement (Alistair Cockburn in particular) and why it's still massively relevant today.<b></p> <p>About Peter Naur: </b>Peter Naur was a Danish computer science pioneer and Turing award winner. His last name is the \"N\" in the BNF notation (Backus-Naur form), used in the description of the syntax for most programming languages. He contributed to the creation of the ALGOL 60 programming language (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur\">from Wikipedia</a>).</p> <p>• <i>A Categorical Theory of Patches</i> by <a href=\"http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/\">Samuel Mimram</a> and <a href=\"http://www.i3s.unice.fr/digiusto/\">Cinzia Di Giusto</a><br/>Presented by Hunter Madison, CustomInk</p> <p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903\">homepage</a> | <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.3903v1\">pdf</a></p> <p><b>Summary: </b>For most of us, version control is an integral part of our professional workflow. It's difficult to imagine working on large teams or long-term projects without the ability to branch or merge! But how does it actually work?</p> <p>This paper takes a look \"under the hood\" of version control–its aim is to provide a formal mathematical definition of patches using category theory. It starts with the basic case of two users who make non-conflicting changes on the same file, goes over increasingly complex examples, and finally explores the general case.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> In contrast to the first paper, this paper is heavy on mathematical terminology and notation. The introduction provides a good summary, and I suggest keeping your browser open to look up unfamiliar terms.

The formalism makes no presuppositions about the representation of primitive data structures and control structures. Such structures can be programmed, micro-coded, or hard wired in a uniform modular fashion. In fact it is impossible to determine whether a given object is \"really\" represented as a list, a vector, a hash table, a function, or a process. The architecture will efficiently run the coming generation of PLANNER-like artificial intelligence languages including those requiring a high degree of parallelism. The efficiency is gained without loss of programming generality because it only makes certain actors more efficient; it does not change their behavioral characteristics. The architecture is general with respect to control structure and does not have or need goto, interrupt, or semaphore primitives. The formalism achieves the goals that the disallowed constructs are intended to achieve by other more structured methods.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1566428400000,"title":"A Universal Modular ACTOR Formalism for Artificial Intelligence","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/263121290/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"268667728":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

GP has already been used in the past for representation learning; however, many of those approaches required of human experts knowledge from the representations’ domain. In this proposal, we explore the pitfalls of developing representation learning systems with GP that do not require experts’ knowledge, and propose a solution based on layered GP structures, similar to those found in Deep Neural Networks.\"</p> ","photos":[],"time":1582156800000,"title":"Papers We Love: \"Deep Representation Learning with Genetic Programming\"","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/268667728/","utcOffset":-18000000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"276408738":{"description":"<p>WE'RE BACK—welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

She is particularly interested in the ideas of structure and symmetry in mechanistic systems as well as how to embed physics priors into data-driven models. She is easily distracted by neat papers and has been involved in the DC branch of Papers We Love since 2016.</p> <p>The schedule will be something like this:<br/>6:00-6:45 - Arrive and socialize.<br/>6:45-7:00 - Introduction and announcements<br/>7:00-7:45 - The paper: *Neural Fields in Visual Computing and Beyond*<br/>7:45-8:00 - Q&amp;A<br/>8:00-8:30 - Informal paper discussion and more socializing.</p> <p>**Venue**: The event will be located in the IRB 4137 (fourth floor conference room) at the Brendan Iribe Center for computer graphics in the University of Maryland.</p> <p>**Parking**: Lot H and the Regents Drive parking garage are the best spot for visitor parking.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.\"</p> <p><b>About Dr. Hadley Wickham:</b> Hadley Wickham is a statistician from New Zealand who is currently Chief Scientist at RStudio and an adjunct Assistant Professor of statistics at Rice University.

However, they struggle with combinatorial tasks that can be solved faster if many operations are performed in parallel. Here, we present proof-of-concept of a parallel computer by solving the specific instance {2, 5, 9} of a classical nondeterministic-polynomial-time complete (“NP-complete”) problem, the subset sum problem. The computer consists of a specifically designed, nanostructured network explored by a large number of molecular-motor-driven, protein filaments. This system is highly energy efficient, thus avoiding the heating issues limiting electronic computers. We discuss the technical advances necessary to solve larger combinatorial problems than existing computation devices, potentially leading to a new way to tackle difficult mathematical problems.</p> <p><b>About Sam: </b>Sam DeLuca is a software engineer at <a href=\"https://www.cloudlock.com/\">CloudLock</a>, a cloud security company based in Massachusetts, where he works on task scheduling and messaging infrastructure.

Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.\"</p> ","photos":[{"height":null,"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/2/b/600_463953323.jpeg","width":null},{"height":null,"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/4/d/600_463953613.jpeg","width":null}],"time":1503529200000,"title":"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/bpckxlywlbfc/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"bpckxlywnbhc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

These Hash Trees require no initial root hash table yet are faster and use significantly less space than chained or double hash trees. Insert, search and delete times are small and constant, independent of key set size, operations are O(1). Small worst-case times for insert, search and removal operations can be guaranteed and misses cost less than successful searches. Array Mapped Tries(AMT), first described in Fast and Space Efficient Trie Searches, Bagwell [2000], form the underlying data structure. The concept is then applied to external disk or distributed storage to obtain an algorithm that achieves single access searches, close to single access inserts and greater than 80 percent disk block load factors. Comparisons are made with Linear Hashing, Litwin, Neimat, and Schneider [1993] and B-Trees, R.Bayer and E.M.McCreight [1972]. In addition two further applications of AMTs are briefly described, namely, Class/Selector dispatch tables and IP Routing tables. Each of the algorithms has a performance and space usage that is comparable to contemporary implementations but simpler.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1519862400000,"title":"Ideal Hash Trees","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/bpckxlyxdblc/","utcOffset":-18000000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"bpckxlyxgbhc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

Where CNNs are specialized for patterns important in image classification, LSTMs are specialized to exploit structure in multivariate time series, and to overcome a well-known problem in training deep nets, the \"vanishing gradients\" problem.

It turns out word embeddings trained end-to-end in this framework parameterize a Lie group and RNNs form a nonlinear representation of the group. The upshot: RNNs in NLP have a structure we have understood for over a century. I propose an interpretation of the action of words on the internal state in the RNN, and propose a new word embedding scheme.</p> <p>The paper is available at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02839\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02839</a> and he has a reduced and simplified version that I will link to in the comments.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1530140400000,"title":"The Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks in Natural Language Processing","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/bpckxlyxjbkc/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"bpckxlyxlbdc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1551312000000,"title":"Deep learning for universal linear embeddings of nonlinear dynamics","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/bpckxlyzdbkc/","utcOffset":-18000000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"bpckxlyzgbgc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!

One way to define a community is as a set of nodes that trap a diffusion-like dynamical process (usually a random walk) for a long time. In this view, communities are sets of nodes that create bottlenecks to the spreading of a dynamical process on a network. We analyze the local behavior of different random walks on multiplex networks (which are multilayer networks in which different layers correspond to different types of edges) and show that they have very different bottlenecks that hence correspond to rather different notions of what it means for a set of nodes to be a good community. This has direct implications for the behavior of community-detection methods that are based on these random walks.</p> <p><b>About Mandi:</b> Mandi is a Senior Data Scientist at <a href=\"https://cybraics.com/\">Cybraics</a>; in the community, she is the co-Founder of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenDataSci/\">Women Data Scientists DC</a> and President of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DataCommunityDC/\">Data Community DC</a>.

The work is motivated by the need of identifying foreground regions in noisy microscopic image or degraded document images, where significant background variation and severe noise make an image binarization challenging. The proposed method first estimates the background of an input image, subtracts the estimated background from the input image, and apply a global thresholding to the subtracted outcome for achieving a binary image of foregrounds. A robust regression approach was proposed to estimate the background intensity surface with minimal effects of foreground intensities and noises, and a global threshold selector was proposed on the basis of a model selection criterion in a sparse regression. The proposed approach was validated using 26 test images and the corresponding ground truths, and the outcomes of the proposed work were compared with those from nine existing image binarization methods. The approach was also combined with three state-of-the-art morphological segmentation methods to show how the proposed approach can improve their image segmentation outcomes.\"</p> ","photos":[],"time":1522278000000,"title":"Regression For Image Binarization Under Heavy Noises and Nonuniform Background","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/ntdzqnyxfblc/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"2300 Wilson Blvd","address2":null,"city":"Arlington","country":"us","lat":38.890525817871094,"lon":-77.08705139160156,"name":"Excella Consulting Arlington Tech Exchange ATX","postalCode":""}},"ntdzqnyxhbfc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

New results are:<br/>(1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters.<br/>(2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations.<br/>(3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem.<br/>The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results.<br/>The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1533164400000,"title":"A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/ntdzqnyxkbhc/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"2300 Wilson Blvd","address2":null,"city":"Arlington","country":"us","lat":38.890525817871094,"lon":-77.08705139160156,"name":"Excella Consulting Arlington Tech Exchange ATX","postalCode":""}},"ntdzqnyxmbjc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.\"</p> ","photos":[],"time":1538002800000,"title":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/ntdzqnyxmbjc/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.872459411621094,"lon":-77.22986602783203,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"ntdzqnyxpblc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

Instead of our usual presentation-and-discussion format, we're going to follow the Lean Coffee format (<a href=\"http://leancoffee.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://leancoffee.org</a>), \"a structured, but agenda-less meeting.\" If you missed an interesting meetup, you'd like to revisit a previous discussion, or something new has caught your eye, this is a great opportunity to bring it up!</p> <p>Lean Coffee has three basic steps:</p> <p>1. We'll start off by writing down topics/papers we're interested in (ex. \"denoising low-light images\", \"recurrent neural networks\", or \"compiler optimizations\").</p> <p>2. Vote on topics.</p> <p>3. Start talking! We'll start with the most popular topic and vote periodically whether to continue the current discussion or move on to the next topic.</p> <p>We hope this'll be a good way to cover a lot of ground in one meeting. Maybe it will inspire some future presentations as well!</p> ","photos":[],"time":1548288000000,"title":"Papers We Love: Lean Coffee Edition","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-dc-nova/events/ntdzqnyzcbfc/","utcOffset":-18000000,"venue":{"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"city":"Fairfax","country":"us","lat":38.8725700378418,"lon":-77.2301254272461,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":""}},"ntdzqnyzfbkc":{"description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.
