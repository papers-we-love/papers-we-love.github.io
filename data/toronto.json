For instance, one may define size-indexed arrays and operations on them so that type-checking guarantees the absence of out-of-bound indexing. This paper applies this machinery, along with Idris's 'interfaces' (or typeclasses), to a somewhat different situation: creating type-safe state transition systems - that is, protocols whose correct usage is similarly guaranteed by their type-correctness. The resulting library, ST, based around the notion of indexed monad, allows specifying protocols which are compositional in both horizontal (multiple protocols can be used simultaneously) and vertical (protocols can be defined in terms of other protocols) senses. We'll see examples, such as safe Unix socket programming, and how additional Idris features combine to improve the usability of this library.

Beresford</p> <p>Many applications model their data in a general-purpose storage format such as JSON. This data structure is modified by the application as a result of user input. Such modifications are well understood if performed sequentially on a single copy of the data, but if the data is replicated and modified concurrently on multiple devices, it is unclear what the semantics should be. In this paper we present an algorithm and formal semantics for a JSON data structure that automatically resolves concurrent modifications such that no updates are lost, and such that all replicas converge towards the same state (a conflict-free replicated datatype or CRDT). It supports arbitrarily nested list and map types, which can be modified by insertion, deletion and assignment. The algorithm performs all merging client-side and does not depend on ordering guarantees from the network, making it suitable for deployment on mobile devices with poor network connectivity, in peer-to-peer networks, and in messaging systems with end-to-end encryption.</p> <p>Paper link: <a href=\"https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/04/24/json-crdt.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/04/24/json-crdt.html</a></p> <p>Andrew Louis is software developer from Toronto.
