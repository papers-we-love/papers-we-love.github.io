Although prior research has shown that APIs commonly suffer from significant usability problems, little attention has been given to studying how APIs are designed and created in the first place. We interviewed 24 professionals involved with API design from 7 major companies to identify their training and design processes. Interviewees had insights into many different aspects of designing for API usability and areas of significant struggle. For example, they learned to do API design on the job, and had little training for it in school. During the design phase they found it challenging to discern which potential use cases of the API users will value most. After an API is released, designers lack tools to gather aggregate feedback from this data even as developers openly discuss the API online.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1539271800000,"title":"API Designers in the Field: Design Practices and Challenges","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-columbus/events/255251518/","utcOffset":-14400000,"venue":{"address1":"141 N High St.","address2":null,"city":"Columbus","country":"us","lat":39.96528625488281,"lon":-83.00164794921875,"name":"Deli Boys","postalCode":""}},"255926327":{"description":"<p>Please join us for lunch and interesting conversations as we discuss the architecture of the web.

Beyond having one of the catchier titles in the history of computer science papers, the paper will keep your attention from beginning to end, an easy read with a great summary of real world experience maintaining large machine learning systems.</p> <p>Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.</p> <p>The paper is available for free (click \"PDF\" at the link above).</p> <p>Please consider joining us for lunch downtown and interesting conversation.
