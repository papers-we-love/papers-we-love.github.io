It states that in a linearizable database, if the network is interrupted, some nodes cannot respond to requests. Although being able to tolerate network faults is important, the performance and response times of a database are often even more important, and CAP says nothing about those. It's also a pretty boring theorem.</p> <p>Attiya and Welch's paper, which we'll discuss in this session, is vastly more interesting. It also proves an impossibility result, but it's about response times: on a network where the uncertainty of packet delay is u, there is no algorithm that implements linearizability with read requests faster than u/4 and write requests faster than u/2. On a network where packet delay is highly variable (like many computer networks), a linearizable database is therefore inevitably going to be slow.</p> <p>The paper then goes on to compare linearizability to sequential consistency (a weaker consistency guarantee), and shows that sequential consistency can be significantly faster.</p> <p>This is a theoretical paper, but its applications to practical systems are very real. Its proofs are elegant and not too difficult to follow. It was almost a decade ahead of the CAP theorem. And moreover, it has no male co-authors.

To fully leverage the potential patterns hidden in the petabytes of DNA and RNA sequence information requires the use of machine learning algorithms and specialised kernels, which can capture the valuable domain knowledge provided by biological scientists. A common problem in computational biology is that of binary classification. Support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved good results in this domain and have thus been eagerly adopted by computational biology researchers. Ben­Hur et al provide a gentle introduction to support vector machines and kernels in the context of binary biological prediction problems.</p> <p>To explain the concepts of large margin separation and kernel functions, Ben­Hur et al use a computational biology problem known as splice­site recognition. In eukaryotic organisms, the process of gene expression involves transcribing a sequence of DNA into a molecule known as premature mRNA. Premature mRNA contains two types of regions: coding regions known as exons and 'junk' regions known as introns. The boundary of these two sites is often recognized by the presence of specific dimers GT and AG at these sites. However, only 0.1%–1% of occurrences of these dimers in the genome represent true locations of splice sites, which leads to an interesting question: Can we use support vector machines to help classify sites as splice sites and non­splice sites?</p> <p>Ben­Hur et al explain the principles of maximum margin separation, kernel functions and classifier performance by exploring various aspects of this question. The paper is a great and gentle introduction into the world of support vector machines and also gives insight into some cool applications of machine learning technology.

Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in computer science during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1989 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She alleged that during this period she encountered a group of mathematical adepts, the “Haskell Language and Library Committee,” who sent her to Glasgow, Scotland, where they trained her to develop her powers of category theory. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period writing JavaScript.</p> <p>Bodil was a controversial figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened guru and derided as a fraudulent charlatan by critics. Her doctrines influenced the spread of Homotopy Type Theory in the West as well as the development of Western computer science currents like dependent types, blockchains and isomorphic JavaScript.</p> <p>The meetup</p> <p>PapersWeLove (<a href=\"http://paperswelove.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://paperswelove.org</a>) London proudly brings to you the best papers every month!

In reality, the “mature” architecture could be a premature optimisation for cases where “real” MVC would be sufficient.<br/>Often, the developers are only familiar with one interpretation of the MVC, the one which is popular on their platform. So I suggest to take a step back, or maybe even a giant leap back to the origins of MVC from 1979, to understand how it emerged and which problem it was trying to solve.<br/>Understanding the original idea and reasoning will help us to trace MVC legacy in modern architectural patterns, and more importantly to implement our own hand-crafted version of MVC.</p> <p>The Speaker</p> <p>Bohdan is an iOS developer, and he believes in getting things done, preferably fast and beautiful (in this order).

Differencing algorithms are the core part of many software engineering tasks. For example, change impact analysis is used to identify the program parts that are affected by changes. For this purpose, the impact analysis uses the information about the location of program changes. Another example includes the program-profile estimation. In this task, for the original and modified program version, the coverage or profile information for the modified program version is estimated based on the coverage or profile information from the original program version and the results of the differencing algorithm. The estimated coverage or profile information can be useful when, for example, it is desirable to eliminate the cost of rerunning the test suite on the modified program version in order to obtain this information.<br/>In this talk, we will discuss a control-flow graph representation of the object-oriented program and a differencing algorithm that works on the control-flow graph representation. We will discuss how this algorithm can identify changes in program behaviour (specific to object-oriented programs) that are caused by syntactic changes. In addition, we will present different heuristics that the algorithm uses in order to increase the precision of the results.</p> <p>The Speaker</p> <p>Marija Katic has MEd in Mathematics and Informatics from the University of Split and a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Zagreb.

As a result of this, their systems needed to cope with workloads they had never experienced before. The existing data storage technologies were not capable of supporting these workloads, because of inherent limitations, such as single point of failures, vertical scaling etc.<br/>In an effort to solve these problems, companies started re-evaluating the architecture of existing systems and started building a new generation of systems, focused on a more distributed, scalable and highly available architecture. Of course, this came with a whole new set of technical challenges that they needed to address.<br/>In this talk, we will be looking at a set of core techniques Amazon used to build their key-value store, referred to as Dynamo in the related paper.

We all use them, but rarely think about designing our own, even though there are clear and well-demonstrated benefits. The main reason is that building good domain-specific languages and, in particular, good tools and infrastructure for them, is difficult, costly, tedious, and often doesn’t immediately result in a product you can sell. Language workbenches fundamentally alter these trade-offs: By leveraging strong language-engineering and automated-generation techniques, they can make it easy and fun to produce new domain-specific languages and sophisticated support infrastructure for them. This finally makes it possible to develop domain-specific languages that work for end users rather than for programmers. In this talk, we use two articles on language workbenches to explore this exciting space. We will look at the core underlying principles of language workbenches and, through brief demonstrations, look at examples of three fundamentally different types of language workbenches.</p> <p>The Speaker</p> <p>Steffen Zschaler is a senior lecturer in computer science at King’s College London.

More recently, his research focus has specifically been on issues of modularity and reuse in language design and on high-level descriptions and tooling for optimisation problems.

They found a recurring pattern that explains how so many people, acting more or less independently, are still able to produce software as a group. We are all taking part in a process of “reconciling perspectives.” The theory is constructed from observation and analysis of real software teams as they go about their day, and can provide a basis for understanding what is happening in our own daily interactions.<br/>The paper is readable and well written, which provides a clear exposition of the model and the methods used. The methods used in the study (grounded theory and related methods) are not something that many software engineers encounter, and they open a door to a different world of research. As such, the paper provides a useful study of software engineering and the methods that can be employed to understand software engineering.</p> <p>The Speaker</p> <p>Andrew Parker is a software engineer who takes a particular interest in the human aspects of software engineering.
