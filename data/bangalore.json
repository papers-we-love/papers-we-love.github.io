No matter whatever high level abstractions you create for talking about these primitive bits (floats, points, lines, boxes, polygons, fish), as long as you are writing programs that work with state, you are bound to run into this combinatorial explosion as you add complexity.

Nearly all prior studies of Rainfall have involved students who were learning imperative programming with arrays.  In our recent multi-university study, students learning functional programming produced atypical profiles of compositions and errors on Rainfall. What do these different results suggest about the problem of plan composition and programming education?</p> <p>This talk raises various questions about the relationships between programming languages, program design, curricula, and how students perceive code structure.  I'll describe results from both our earlier Rainfall study and some work-in-progress that attempts to further tease apart these relationships.  The talk assumes no experience with either functional programming or having been rained upon.</p> <p>Joint work primarily with Kathi Fisler.</p> <p>A bit of rambling from a meetup organizer.

There have been many efforts to integrate static and dynamic typing and thereby combine the benefits of both typing disciplines in the same language. The flexibility of static typing can be improved by adding a type Dynamic and a typecase form. The safety and performance of dynamic typing can be improved by adding optional type annotations or by performing type inference (as in soft typing). However, there has been little formal work on type systems that allow a programmer-controlled migration between dynamic and static typing. </p> <p> In this paper we present a solution based on the intuition that the structure of a type may be partially known/unknown at compile-time and the job of the type system is to catch incompatibilities between the known parts of types. We define the static and dynamic semantics of a λ calculus with optional type annotations and we prove that its type system is sound with respect to the simply-typed λ calculus for fully-annotated terms. We prove that this calculus is type safe and that the cost of dynamism is pay-as-you-go.</p> ","photos":[],"time":1458379800000,"title":"Gradual Typing for Functional Languages","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bangalore/events/229428090/","utcOffset":19800000,"venue":{"address1":"CV raman road bangalore","address2":null,"city":"Bangalore","country":"in","lat":13.014486312866211,"lon":77.57023620605469,"name":"IISc bangalore","postalCode":null}},"229956836":{"description":"<p>Vaidhy will be presenting the famous FLP paper in distributed systems:</p> <p>Fischer Lynch Paterson wrote a paper on Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process :</p> <p><a href=\"https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf\"><a href=\"https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Kashyap: Meetup.com's geolocation is kind of screwed up.

Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).</i></p> <p><b>Reference Paper</b>:  <a href=\"http://hal.upmc.fr/inria-00555588/document\">A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a></p> <p><b>Overview</b>: Replication is a fundamental concept of distributed systems. Any data update must be replicated to all peers in the system, if the system were to behave like a single system. This is usually achieved  by introducing coordination, but it is expensive and can become infeasible quickly. An alternative approach is to build systems that are eventually consistent by removing coordination from the hot path, but there can be conflicts and conflict resolution is generally complex. </p> <p>CRDT's are any data structures (and associated operations) that have some simple mathematical properties. These properties are immensely useful in building distributed systems that are eventually consistent and conflict free by design. There are may known CRDT's and the paper listed above catalogs them. While CRDT's are not general purpose, a lot of real life problems can be solved by using CRDT's. </p> <p>In this talk, I hope to cover everything needed from the ground up, including the rudimentary mathematics needed to understand CRDT's, walk through some of the data structures and prove that they are CRDT's, discuss problems that can be solved with CRDT's, their practical limitations, along with a general discussion/rant on distributed systems, consensus and consistency models. </p> <p>- Vipin</p> ","photos":[],"time":1484991000000,"title":"CRDT: Conflict-free replicated data types","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bangalore/events/236168678/","utcOffset":19800000,"venue":{"address1":"Bagmane Tech Park, Bysandra, C V Raman Nagar","address2":null,"city":"Bangalore","country":"in","lat":12.978517532348633,"lon":77.66461944580078,"name":"Concur Technologies, 3rd Floor, B-block, Bagmane Laurel","postalCode":null}},"236984100":{"description":"<p>We will be discussing the classic paper which kickstarted the area of Statistical Machine Translation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Spring_2011/cogs502/Brown1990.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Spring_2011/cogs502/Brown1990.pdf</a></p> <p>The following is a explanatory document discussing the translation models, EM algorithm and provides mathematical proofs:  <a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/ibm12.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/ibm12.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/ibm12.pdf</a></a></p> <p>And finally, these are slides discussing the same material but with more examples and easier to understand: <a href=\"http://www.statmt.org/book/slides/04-word-based-models.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.statmt.org/book/slides/04-word-based-models.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.statmt.org/book/slides/04-word-based-models.pdf</a></a></p> ","photos":[],"time":1486200600000,"title":"A statistical approach to machine translation with Abhaya Agarwal","url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bangalore/events/236984100/","utcOffset":19800000,"venue":{"address1":"4th floor, Maa grace building, Koramanagala","address2":null,"city":"Bangalore","country":"in","lat":12.929506301879883,"lon":77.63265991210938,"name":"Instamojo","postalCode":null}},"237750761":{"description":"<p>Let's discuss central limit theorem. .
