<p>Ada Gavrilovska - Panelist</p>
<p>Ada Gavrilovska is an associate professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. She directs the Kernel research group, focused on performance, scalability and efficiency problems across the systems software stack, including operating, distributed, and high-performance computing systems. Gavrilovska's research is supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, industry support from Cisco, Facebook, HPE, Intel, Intercontinental Exchange, LexisNexis, Samsung, VMware, and others, and the Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center co-sponsored by the Semiconductor Research Corporation and DARPA. She served as the program co-chair of the USENIX Annual Technical Conference in 2020.</p>

<p>Joe Hellerstein - Panelist</p>
<p>Joseph M. Hellerstein is the Jim Gray Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, whose work focuses on data-centric systems and the way they drive computing. He is an ACM Fellow, an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow and the recipient of three ACM-SIGMOD "Test of Time" awards for his research. Fortune Magazine has included him in their list of 50 smartest people in technology, and MIT's Technology Review magazine included his work on their TR10 list of the 10 technologies "most likely to change our world".</p>
<p>Hellerstein is the co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Trifacta, a software vendor providing intelligent interactive solutions to the messy problem of wrangling data. He has served on the technical advisory boards of a number of computing and Internet companies including Dell EMC, SurveyMonkey, Captricity, and Datometry, and previously served as the Director of Intel Research, Berkeley.</p>

<p>Dan R. K. Ports - Panelist</p>
<p>I am a researcher in the Systems Research Group at Microsoft Research.</p>
<p>My research focuses on distributed systems – using a combination of new algorithms and systems techniques to build practical systems that are faster, more reliable, easier to program, and more secure.</p>
<p>I take a broad view of the systems field: besides distributed systems, I've worked in operating systems, networking, databases, architecture, and security. I believe that looking across the entire systems stack yields interesting opportunities at the intersection of these areas.</p>
<p>Most of my work these days involves rethinking how distributed systems should be built for the datacenter environment. I lead the Prometheus project at MSR, which asks how we can use new reconfigurable devices, such as programmable dataplane switches and smart NICs, to support advanced systems applications. The key idea is to co-design distributed systems with new network primitives.</p>
<p>Before joining MSR, I was on the faculty in CSE at the University of Washington. I still advise a few excellent students over there. An increasingly long time ago (i.e., 2012), I was a student at MIT, where I was (approximately) Barbara Liskov's last Ph.D. graduate. Even before that, I was an undergraduate at MIT.</p>

<p>Justine Sherry - Panelist</p>
<p>Justine Sherry is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Her interests are in computer networking; her work includes middleboxes, networked systems, measurement, cloud computing, and congestion control. Dr. Sherry received her PhD (2016) and MS (2012) from UC Berkeley, and her BS and BA (2010) from the University of Washington. She is a recipient of the SIGCOMM doctoral dissertation award, the David J. Sakrison prize, paper awards at USENIX NSDI and ACM SIGCOMM, and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Most importantly, she is always on the lookout for a great cappuccino.</p>

<p>Hakim Weatherspoon - Panelist</p>
<p>I received my PhD in 2006 from the University of California, Berkeley, in the area of secure and fault-tolerant distributed wide-area storage systems (e.g. Antiquity, OceanStore, etc.). I received a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Washington in 1999.</p>
