# Upgrade Middleman to Version 4

## Description

The Papers We Love site uses Middleman `https://middlemanapp.com/` as its static site generator. We need to upgrade to Middleman Version 4 `https://middlemanapp.com/basics/upgrade-v4/` and also upgrade to a more recent version of Ruby. We will take a step by step approach, planning out each step in detail before proceeding. After each step you will prompt me to test the site with the dev server to see how it's working.
