# Beijing Chapter

This is the the Beijing chapter of Papers We Love.

We are a study group of academic/research papers of computer science in Beijing. We'd love to share knowledge, join discussions, and talk about the hard stuff in this area.

We follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/beijing/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). We are open to people from different backgrounds and we respect human and community.

Both English and Chinese presentations are welcome.
