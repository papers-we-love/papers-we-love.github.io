# Cairo

We are a community of computer scientists and engineers that are either interested in research papers or desire to get involved in research papers for academic contribution or for improving their career prospects. We deal with papers that have both theoretical and practical inclination but with an increased focus on the practical side. 
Besides gaining further knowledge, another goal of our meetups is to provide a medium for people to collaborate in conducting new research and start-ups especially that the academic institutions in Egypt are still behind in the quality and quantity of research projects especially in emerging fields like neural networks

Please visit our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Cairo/) page to see join us.
