# Columbus Chapter

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.

We'll be using [papers-we-love's curated repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love). Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.

PWL Columbus strictly adheres to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) set forth by all PWL charters.
