# San Francisco Chapter

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic or research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.

We typically meet the second-to-last Thursday of each month at Antithesis's office downtown. Starting in 2026, we use [our chapter's Github repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/san-francisco) as a curated collection of interesting papers: please open PRs with interesting papers, code, or links.

We strictly adhere to the same [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/san-francisco/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as the original chapter in NYC.
