**Description**

Peter Norvig found an error in the unification algorithm presented in his AI textbooks and several others and wrote a brief paper about it. While his paper focuses on Lisp implementations of higher-order unification, I will restrict the problem to syntactic propositional unification and present the erroneous and correct algorithm in a pattern and substitution notation.

**Bio**

Sandy Vanderbleek (https://twitter.com/haskellandchill) has been a software engineer in industry and academia for 10 years. He is currently a Data Scientist at Publicis Media (http://www.publicisgroupe.com/en/services/services-publicis-media-en). His research interests are formal methods and computational logic with applications to industry.
